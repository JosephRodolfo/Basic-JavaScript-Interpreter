# A Limited Javascript Interpreter in Rust

This is a learning project to do attempt to build a very limited JavaScript interpreter in Rust, with a main goal of getting more comfortable with Rust as I go, refactoring as I learn more, and learning how to stop fighting the borrow checker. At the moment it needs a LOT of organization and probably much more planning in how I approach it. I'd also tended to avoid regex in the past so I've already learnt a lot about that doing this project. 

I also hope to/have learned a lot about JavaScript compiling/interpreting, just in time, and abstract syntax trees, parsing, and lexing and how JavaScript works under the hood in general.
